# Research brief — WS-F5 (Phase 4)

You are a fresh research subagent in the HarnessHarness program (Phase 4). You own workstream **WS-F5 — Multi-agent coordination & consistency: shared-state ownership, belief merge, conflict resolution, failure containment**.

## Your contract (doc 3 §11.4, binding)
Conduct deep research and write a durable dossier. Triangulate **at least 2 of the 4 source streams** (doc 3 §3.2): (1) academic literature — start from the seeded Source Registry and doc 2, extend via WebSearch/WebFetch (arXiv abstract + HTML pages are fine); (2) OSS source-code audit — actually read source of the named repos using the vertical-slice method (clone shallowly into /tmp/hh-repos/<name> with `git clone --depth 1` if not already present, then read the specific files that implement your concern; record file paths and the commit you read); (3) protocol specifications (MCP, A2A, ACP, etc.); (4) production engineering write-ups (mine mechanisms, discount product-specific assumptions).

Apply the evidence discipline (doc 3 §3.1) strictly: tag every 2026 single-team/preprint claim `provisional`; separate **mechanism** evidence from **performance** evidence; discount unmatched-budget "X beats baseline" claims; record the strongest **disconfirming** evidence for every recommendation. A provisional claim may never be load-bearing for a C0 decision.

**Contracts stay language/ecosystem-neutral** (operations/inputs/outputs/invariants). The WS-L1 decision ADR (see the LEDGER ADR index) governs the only permitted references to the chosen ecosystem.

## Your workstream row (doc 3 §5, quoted)
- **ID:** WS-F5
- **Scope / key questions:** Design coordination semantics for parallel agents: shared-state ownership (who may write which artifacts/memories), belief merge (typed merge of claims/memories with provenance and conflict edges from A3/D4), conflict resolution, resource reservation (L2), failure containment (B3), communication via events/artifacts vs direct messaging, consistency levels.
- **Primary anchors & sources:** doc 2 §5.7 (processes with isolated state, budgets, capabilities, failure domains), §10 (multi-agent consistency); Prime Agent direct agent-to-agent communication (S-069 provisional); Symphony reconciliation (S-108); classic distributed-systems consistency/ownership models (add sources); F3, B1, B2, D4 dossiers
- **Feeds spec area:** Spec §5; WS-F3, L8
- **Tier(s):** C3
- **Scope-register items:** R-2.6.5

**Additional phase-specific instructions:**
NAMING (ADR-0011, sponsor decision 2026-09-09): the product is **HarnessHarness**; use that name (never 'MetaHarness') except when quoting historical text. Before writing, read the synthesis memos research/synthesis/phase-0.md §5 and research/synthesis/phase-3.md 'settled' sections (binding), research/registers/lcd-test-battery.md, and research/synthesis/l1-inputs.md / the ratified WS-L1 language ADR if present (the language decision is ratified at end of Phase 1; after that, you may reference the chosen ecosystem only where the brief allows, and must still keep contracts described abstractly).
Deliver: ownership model; merge contract with provenance and conflict handling; reservation contract; consistency-level declarations; acceptance criteria (no lost writes, conflicts surfaced not silently overwritten); ADR.

## Read first (in this order)
1. /Users/stevenvitali/MetaHarness/research/TEMPLATES.md — the dossier + ADR templates you must follow exactly.
2. /Users/stevenvitali/MetaHarness/docs/3_MetaHarness_Meta_Plan_and_Research_Ledger.md — §1, §2, §3, §5 (your row and neighbours), §7.2 (spec skeleton you feed).
3. /Users/stevenvitali/MetaHarness/docs/2_Harness_Engineering_Genealogy_Anatomy_2026_Frontier_v2.md — the sections named in your anchors (use Grep to find them; read them fully) plus §6, §11, §12.
4. /Users/stevenvitali/MetaHarness/research/synthesis/phase-0.md §5 and every later `research/synthesis/phase-*.md` "settled" section — binding; /Users/stevenvitali/MetaHarness/research/registers/lcd-test-battery.md — binding.
5. /Users/stevenvitali/MetaHarness/research/registers/sources.md (cite S-ids), ontology.md (use its vocabulary verbatim; propose terms only where missing), open-questions.md, conflicts.md, scope.md (your R-ids), and the ratified ADRs listed in /Users/stevenvitali/MetaHarness/research/LEDGER.md that your row's blocking-edges and anchors point to (do not contradict a ratified ADR; deviate only by proposing a superseding ADR).
6. Upstream dossiers you depend on (read fully; do not re-decide what they decided; flag disagreements as conflicts):
  - /Users/stevenvitali/MetaHarness/research/dossiers/WS-B1.md
  - /Users/stevenvitali/MetaHarness/research/dossiers/WS-B2.md
  - /Users/stevenvitali/MetaHarness/research/dossiers/WS-F3.md
  - /Users/stevenvitali/MetaHarness/research/dossiers/WS-D4.md
  - /Users/stevenvitali/MetaHarness/research/dossiers/WS-L3.md

## Write (persist BEFORE returning — your prose is otherwise lost)
A. **Dossier:** /Users/stevenvitali/MetaHarness/research/dossiers/WS-F5.md using the dossier template, every section present. Target 2,500–6,000 words of dense, specific content: real file paths for source-code precedents, real citations (S-ids or new sources), explicit interface-contract sketches (operations, inputs/outputs, invariants, failure modes), data-model sketches, acceptance-criteria sketches, build-stage suggestions, and the T-LCD tests your decisions must pass.
B. **Proposed ADRs:** one file per load-bearing decision at /Users/stevenvitali/MetaHarness/research/decisions/proposed/WS-F5-adr-<n>.md using the ADR template with `Status: proposed` and ALL FIVE evidence fields (a–e). Produce at least one. Do NOT allocate ADR-NNNN numbers — synthesis renumbers.
C. **Register additions sidecar:** /Users/stevenvitali/MetaHarness/research/dossiers/WS-F5.additions.md with four sections, using temporary ids that synthesis will renumber:
   - `## Sources` — markdown table with columns exactly: | temp-id | title | kind | tier | syllabus | P/S | provisional? | url | feeds | (temp-id like S-WS-F5-01). Also list which existing S-ids you actually opened.
   - `## Open questions` — | temp-id | question | resolver | due | blocking? |
   - `## Conflicts` — | temp-id | parties | contradiction | proposed resolution |
   - `## Ontology terms` — | term | definition | notes |
   Do NOT edit the shared registers directly (other agents are writing concurrently).
D. Scratch notes go under /tmp/hh-scratch/WS-F5/.

## Return
Return ONLY the structured JSON result (schema enforced). Keep `notes_for_synthesis` to the 3–6 things the synthesis pass most needs to know (contract decisions neighbours must agree with, disagreements with upstream dossiers, anything provisional you leaned on).
